# JiraTDD

"Test-driven development" refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

Im currently creating a Jira-like dashboard to train myself on TDD, using laravel 5.8 and some tutorials on Laracast
